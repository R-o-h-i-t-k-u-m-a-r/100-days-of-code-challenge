# 100-days-of-code-challenge
Challenging my self to practice DSA problem for 100 days continouslly.
As a programmer, I've come to understand the importance of having a strong foundation in DSA concepts. They're the backbone of efficient and optimized programming, and can help make our code faster, more reliable, and easier to maintain.

In my first DSA practice post, I'm diving into some of the fundamental concepts of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, and stacks. I'll be sharing my thought process, my code, and my solutions to common DSA problems, with the hope of helping other programmers learn and grow alongside me.
